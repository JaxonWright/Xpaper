### Description
Look at you with your custom Moto X that you designed in Moto Maker! Now you want to make sure you have a sweet wallpaper that matches the colors of your device, but it is a pain to find any. This is where Xpaper comes in! Specifically designed for all Moto X models, Xpaper provides a collection of simple, abstract wallpapers that you can customize to perfectly match your device's configuration. Even if you do not have a Moto X, you are still welcome to play with the app to get some clean wallpapers for your non-moto.
